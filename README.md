# Integrating-simulations-data-management-and-visualisation-of-Whole-Cell-model
MSc project, using clustering, data processing, PCA


thesis-zx16649.pdf is the thesis of my MSc project which contained
  
  How I mange the data
  
  The comparision of the clustering models like K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering and DBSCAN
  
  The improvement of the accuracy for the agglomerative model
  
  Evaluation of the system
 
  
For the code:

data_pre.py is the data preprocessing without normalisation

data_pre_nor.py is the data preprocessing with normalisation

normalisation.py is finding the scale of the normalisation for the data

clustering_model.py is the application of the clustering model

plot_dataframe.py is used to visualise the raw data of the whole cell model
